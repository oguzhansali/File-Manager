# File Manager Web Application (React)
This project is a React-based file management application that integrates seamlessly with a backend service. The application provides users with an intuitive interface for managing files and incorporates the following features:

1- Data Retrieval : Utilized React's state management and lifecycle methods to fetch and display data dynamically from a backend service through API routing.

2- File Management: Implemented functionality for file addition and deletion. Users can upload new files and delete existing ones, with all changes synchronized between the frontend and backend in real-time.

3- Interactive User Interface: Built a responsive and user-friendly interface using React components, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.

4- API Integration: Leveraged Axios for handling HTTP requests, enabling efficient communication with the backend service.
